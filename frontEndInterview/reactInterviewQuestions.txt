1>Explain the concept of virtual DOM , Shadow DOM in reactjs:-
ans:>The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM (Document Object Model) that 
     React uses to optimize UI updates. It is  designed to improve performance and simplify
      UI updates by avoiding direct manipulation of the real DOM.
    Shadow DOM:-The Shadow DOM is a browser technology that allows developers to encapsulate 
    the DOM and style of a component. It is used in Web Components to create isolated 
    components with their own DOM tree.


2>What is a Higher order Component? Explain with examples.
ans:>A higher order component is an advanced react pattern for reusing component logic.It is a 
     function that takes a component as an input and returns a new component with added functionality
     Higher order components are used for tasks like authentication ,logging without duplicating codes
     for example refer to ReactSystemDesign

3>what are the different react design patterns?
ans:>React design patterns help in writing clean,maintainable and scalable code .Below are some 
     widely used react design patterns:
     a:- Presentational and container components
          1:-Presentational components:-Focus on how things look(UI),receive data via props and have no direct state management
             logic
          2:-Container components:-Focus on how things work,manage state handle logic and provide data to the presentational components
          eg:ToDo
     b:Higher order component
     c:-custom hook
     d:-controlled and uncontrolled component
     e:-context api for state sharing

4>how to use react testing library and jest?

5>const incrementHandler = () => {
 setCount(count + 5);
 setCount(count + 5);
 setCount(count + 5);
 console.log(count);
};

Then I asked:

❓ What will console.log(count) print?
 ❓ What will be the updated count value on the UI?

Most candidates answered 15.
 But guess what?
👇 The real answer:
console.log(count) → 0
UI shows → 5
Here’s why:

useState updates are asynchronous.
React batches state updates.

All three calls use the same stale value of count.
✅ To make it work correctly:

setCount(prev => prev + 5);
setCount(prev => prev + 5);
setCount(prev => prev + 5);

Now the final state will be 15, as expected.
