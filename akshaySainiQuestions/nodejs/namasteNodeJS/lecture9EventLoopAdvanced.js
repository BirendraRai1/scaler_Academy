/*
Non-IO loops: Execution order process.nextTick() > setTimeout() > setImmediate()and other timers in non IO loops
IO loops: Execution order process.nextTick() > setImmediate() > setTimeout() and other timers in non IO loops
setTimeout isnâ€™t reliable always

Note: In I/O cycles (e.g., inside fs.readFile), setImmediate always runs before setTimeout

*/ 

/*
Best Practices
process.nextTick(): Avoid recursion (can starve I/O). Use setImmediate for heavy tasks.

setImmediate(): Use instead of setTimeout(fn, 0) for non-timer tasks (more efficient).

setTimeout(): Use for actual time-based delays.
