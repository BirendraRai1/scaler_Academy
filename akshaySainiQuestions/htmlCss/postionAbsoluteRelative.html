<!-- The "Relative Box" would be shifted 20px down and 30px right from where it would have been without top/left. 
 However, the "Normal Flow Box" would still appear below the original space that the "Relative Box" 
 occupied, leaving a gap where "Relative Box" was supposed to be. -->


 Feature                   position: relative;                  position: absolute;

Document Flow   Stays in normal flow; preserves its space.    Removed from normal flow; no space preserved.

Positioning Ref  Relative to its original position.        Relative to its closest positioned ancestor (or body).

top/left/etc.     Offsets from original position.         Positions within its containing block.

Use Case      Minor adjustments, creating positioning context for children. Overlays, precise placement, overlapping elements.
