Q>what is flex-wrap?
Ans>flex-wrap: nowrap; (default):
       Flex items are forced onto a single line, potentially causing overflow if the items are wider than the container. 
flex-wrap: wrap;:
       flex-wrap is a CSS property that controls how flex items are arranged 
       within a flex container when there isn't enough space on a single line.
    It determines whether items should wrap onto multiple lines or be forced 
        onto a single line. By default, flex items are forced onto a single line (no wrap),
         which can lead to overflow if the items' combined width exceeds the container's width. 
         Setting flex-wrap to wrap allows items to wrap onto multiple lines, improving 
         responsiveness and preventing overflow. 
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;:
Similar to wrap, but the order of the lines is reversed. 


Q>If the padding property has two values:

padding: 25px 50px;
top and bottom paddings are 25px
right and left paddings are 50px


Q>Difference between gap and margin?
In CSS, margin creates space around an element, while gap creates space 
between elements within a grid or flexbox container. Margins are for 
individual element spacing, while gaps are for spacing between items in a 
layout.
