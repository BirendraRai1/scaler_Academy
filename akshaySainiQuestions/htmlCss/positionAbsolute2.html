<!-- When you set an element to position: absolute;, it means:

It's removed from the normal document flow. This is the biggest difference from relative. When an element is absolute, it no longer takes up any space where it was originally placed. 
Other elements will collapse and fill its original spot.

It's positioned "relative to its closest positioned ancestor." This is critical.

If no ancestor has position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky, then the absolute element will 
position itself relative to the initial containing block (usually the <body> or <html> element).

If an ancestor does have a position value other than static (most commonly relative), then the 
absolute element will position itself relative to that ancestor's padded edge.

You must use top, right, bottom, and left to place it. Without these properties, an absolutely 
positioned element will appear where it would have if it were static, but still without affecting the 
flow. -->


<!-- The "Child (position: absolute)" box would be placed 20px from the top and 30px from the left of its parent (.parent-relative). The "Parent" box would still occupy its normal space. The "Another Element" would appear after the 
 "Parent" box, completely unaffected by the "Child (position: absolute)" box, because the child
  was removed from the flow -->
