what is difference between promise and async await?
is async await synchronous?
Ans>In this way, an async function without an await expression will run synchronously. 
If there is an await expression inside the function body, however, the async function will always complete asynchronously. 
Code after each await expression can be thought of as existing in a .then callback
for example>function body without await is synchronous
console.log("before async await")
async function hello(){
console.log("Entered inside hello")
 const response = fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
 console.log("response is",response)
}
hello()
console.log("after async await")

2>function body with await is asynchronous
console.log("before async await")
async function hello(){
console.log("Entered inside hello")
 const response =await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
 console.log("response is",response)
}
hello()
console.log("after async await")
