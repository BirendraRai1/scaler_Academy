//Single Element in a Sorted Array
You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

var singleNonDuplicate = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length
    if(n==1)
        return nums[0]
    let l = 0
    let r = n-1
    while(l<=r){
        let mid = parseInt((l+r)/2)
        if(nums[mid]!=nums[mid+1] && nums[mid]!=nums[mid-1])
            return nums[mid]
        let first = mid
        if(nums[mid-1]==nums[mid])
            first = mid-1
        if(first%2==0){
            l = first+2
        }
        else{
            r = first-1
        }
    }
};
