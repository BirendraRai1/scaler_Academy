/*
Your child component is being rendered despite applying React.memo because React.memo only 
prevents re-renders when the props of the component do not change. In this case, the Child 
component is not receiving any props, so React.memo doesn't optimize it for re-renders 
because React cannot detect a difference in propsâ€”it will simply re-render whenever the 
parent component (App) renders
