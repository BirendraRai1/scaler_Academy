1>difference between package.json and package-lock.json
    Version Control: package.json specifies version ranges, while package-lock.json locks them to specific versions for exact reproduction.
    Updates: When installing a new package or updating a dependency, package.json and package-lock.json are both updated, but only package-lock.json records the entire dependency tree.
    Use Case: package.json is for project configuration and package specifications, whereas package-lock.json ensures stability across environments.


2>difference between tilde and carat in package.json while installing dependencies
    1. Tilde (~)
            Syntax: ~major.minor.patch
            Behavior: Allows updates to the patch version (the last number) but not to the minor or major versions.
            Example: ~1.2.3 will accept updates to versions like 1.2.4, 1.2.5, etc., but it will not update to 1.3.0 or 2.0.0.
            Use Case: Ideal for cases where you want to limit updates to bug fixes and small changes, reducing the chance of compatibility issues due to feature changes in minor updates.
    2. Caret (^)
    Syntax: ^major.minor.patch
    Behavior: Allows updates to the minor and patch versions but not to the major version.
    Example: ^1.2.3 will accept updates to any version 1.x.x (like 1.3.0, 1.4.5, etc.), but it wonâ€™t update to 2.0.0.
    Use Case: Useful when you want to allow non-breaking updates (minor and patch versions) but want to avoid major updates, which could introduce breaking changes.
